Eve: *gasp* Oh no...
Pride: Hm? Oh. It's you.
Eve: Where were you? When she died?
Pride: I took that loss just as hard as you did, but you have to find the silver linings here kiddo.

Eve: Your hobbies..? And what about me?
Pride: If you see it my way, look what raising a daughter got me.
Pride: A whiny little brat who doesn't know her place.
