Envy: Oh, there you are! I was worried sick!
Eve: No, get away!
Envy: Now, that’s not any way to talk to your mother…
Eve: You’re not-
Envy: I am now. 
Envy: You will talk when you are addressed. Now get ready for dinner.
Eve: You’re not her! Just tell me how to get out of here!
Envy: Tsk tsk… Someone’s being ornery today.
Envy: I’ll remind you one last time. You live under my roof, and you’ll follow my rules.
